Welcome to Whisper Toggle!

Talk to your computer. It types for you.

This installer sets up everything you need:

  - A local AI speech recognition engine (Whisper)
  - A system tray app that listens for your hotkey
  - Auto-paste into any application

After installation:
  1. A green circle appears in your system tray
  2. Press Ctrl+` (backtick, the key above Tab)
  3. Say something
  4. Press Ctrl+` again
  5. Your words appear where your cursor is

No internet required after install. No accounts. No subscriptions.
Your voice never leaves your computer.

Note: First launch takes 1-2 minutes while the AI model loads.
      An NVIDIA GPU makes transcription fast (~2 sec).
      No GPU? It still works, just slower (~10-15 sec).
